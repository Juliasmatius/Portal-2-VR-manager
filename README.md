# Portal 2 VR mod manager
A batch script to enable/disable Portal 2 VR mod

To report issues go to [Issues](https://github.com/Juliasmatius/Portal-2-VR-manager/issues). \
Most likely I will not fix these issues as the project is abandoned and not really used.

# Setup
1. Download [Portal 2 VR mod](https://github.com/Gistix/portal2vr)
2. Install the mod (guide on main page)
3. Download ModManager.bat from [Releases](https://github.com/Juliasmatius/Portal-2-VR-manager/releases/tag/release)
4. Set ModManager.bat in portal 2's root folder (the place with portal2.exe)
5. Run ModManager.bat to enable/disable mod.
